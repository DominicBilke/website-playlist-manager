# Playlist Manager - Project Status Report

## Overview
This report summarizes the comprehensive cleanup and error correction performed on the Playlist Manager project to ensure it is fully operational.

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Authentication System Issues
**Problem**: Multiple instances of Auth class being created unnecessarily
- **Files affected**: `login.php`, `signup.php`
- **Issue**: These files were creating new Auth instances even though `init.php` already creates one
- **Fix**: Removed redundant Auth instantiation, now using the global `$auth` object from `init.php`

### 2. Login Method Parameter Mismatch
**Problem**: Login method called with wrong number of parameters
- **File affected**: `login.php`
- **Issue**: `$auth->login()` was called with 3 parameters but method only accepts 2
- **Fix**: Removed the `$remember` parameter from the login call

### 3. Missing Language Keys
**Problem**: Several language keys were missing from the translation system
- **Files affected**: `script/languages.php`
- **Missing keys**: 
  - `create_account`
  - `join_playlist_manager`
  - `username`
  - `enter_username`
  - `enter_team`
- **Fix**: Added all missing keys to both English and German translations

### 4. Language Key Mismatch
**Problem**: Inconsistent language key names
- **File affected**: `signup.php`
- **Issue**: Using `signup_success` instead of `signup_successful`
- **Fix**: Updated to use the correct key name

### 5. Session Variable Inconsistency
**Problem**: Inconsistent session variable names
- **File affected**: `components/header.php`
- **Issue**: Using `$_SESSION['user_role']` instead of `$_SESSION['role']`
- **Fix**: Updated to use the correct session variable name

### 6. Missing CSS Classes
**Problem**: Missing button styling classes
- **File affected**: `assets/css/main.css`
- **Issue**: `btn-warning` class was not defined
- **Fix**: Added complete `btn-warning` styling with hover states
