										<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
									</header>


<h2>General</h2>
<p>As the operator of this website and as a company, we come into contact with your personal data. This concerns all data that reveals something about you and by which you can be identified. In this privacy policy, we would like to explain how, for what purpose and on which legal basis we process your data.</p>
<p>Responsible for the data processing (“data controller”) on this website and in our company is:</p>
<p>Highlight-Concerts GmbH</p>
<p>Holstenbrücke 8-10</p>
<p>24103 Kiel</p>
<div>
 <p>Deutschland</p>
</div>
<p>Phone: +49 (0)431 23 95 22 – 0</p>
<p>E-mail: info [at] highlight-concerts [dot] com</p>
<h2>General information</h2>
<div>
 <h3>SSL or TLS encryption</h3>
 <p>When you enter your data on websites, place online orders or send e-mails via the Internet, you must always be prepared for unauthorized third parties to access your data. There is no complete protection against such access. However, we do our utmost to protect your data as best we can and to close security gaps as far as we can.</p>
 <p>An important protection mechanism is the SSL or TLS encryption of our website, which ensures that data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties. You can recognize the encryption by the lock icon in front of the Internet address entered in your browser and by the fact that our Internet address begins with https:// and not with http://.</p>
</div>
<h3>How long do we store your data?</h3>
<p>In some parts in this privacy policy, we inform you about how long we or the companies that process your data on our behalf will store your data. In the absence of such information, we store your data until the purpose of the data processing no longer applies, you object to the data processing or you revoke your consent to the data processing.</p>
<p>In the event of an objection or revocation, we may however continue to process your data if at least one of the following conditions applies:</p>
<ul>
 <li>We have compelling legitimate grounds for continuing to process the data that override your interests, rights and freedoms (only applies in the case of an objection to data processing; if the objection is to direct marketing, we cannot provide legitimate grounds).</li>
 <li>The data processing is necessary to assert, exercise or defend legal claims (does not apply if your objection is directed against direct advertising).</li>
 <li>We are required by law to retain your data.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this case, we will delete your data as soon as the requirement(s) cease to apply.</p>
<h2>Your rights</h2>
<h3>Objection to data processing</h3>
<p>IF IT'S STATED IN THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT THAT WE HAVE LEGITIMATE INTERESTS FOR THE PROCESSING OF YOUR DATA AND THAT THIS PROCESSING IS THEREFORE BASED ON ART. 6 PARA. 1 SENTENCE 1 LIT. F) GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT IN ACCORDANCE WITH ART. 21 GDPR. THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING THAT IS CARRIED OUT ON THE BASIS OF THE AFOREMENTIONED PROVISION. THE PREREQUISITE IS THAT YOU STATE REASONS FOR THE OBJECTION THAT ARISE FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION. NO REASONS ARE REQUIRED IF THE OBJECTION IS DIRECTED AGAINST THE USE OF YOUR DATA FOR DIRECT ADVERTISING.</p>
<p>THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE OBJECTION IS THAT WE MAY NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR DATA. THIS ONLY DOES NOT APPLY IF ONE OF THE FOLLOWING PREREQUISITS EXISTS:</p>
<ul>
 <li>WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING THAT OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS.</li>
 <li>THE PROCESSING IS NECESSARY FOR ASSERTING, EXERCISING OR DEFENDING LEGAL CLAIMS.</li>
</ul>
<p>THESE EXCEPTIONS DO NOT APPLY IF YOUR OBJECTION IS DIRECTED AGAINST THE USE OF YOUR DATA FOR DIRECT ADVERTISING OR TO PROFILING RELATED TO IT.</p>
<h3>Other rights</h3>
<h4>Withdrawal of your consent to data processing</h4>
<p>Many data processing operations are based on your consent. You can give this consent, for example, by ticking the appropriate box on online forms before you send the form, or by allowing the operation of certain cookies when you visit our website. You may revoke your consent at any time without giving reasons (Art. 7 (3) GDPR). From the time of revocation, we may then no longer process your data. The only exception: we are required by law to retain the data for a certain period of time. Such retention periods exist in particular in tax and commercial law.</p>
<h4>Right to complain to the competent supervisory authority</h4>
<p>If you believe that we are in breach of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), you have the right to complain to a supervisory authority in accordance with Art. 77 GDPR. You may contact a supervisory authority in the Member State of your residence, place of work or the place where the alleged infringement took place. The right to complain exists alongside administrative or judicial remedies.</p>
<h4>Right to data portability</h4>
<p>We must hand over data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract to you or a third party in a common machine-readable format if you request this. We can only transfer the data to another “data controller” if this is technically possible.</p>
<h4>Right to information, deletion, and correction of data</h4>
<p>According to Art. 15 GDPR, you have the right to receive information free of charge about which of your personal data we have stored, where the data came from, to whom we transmit the data and for what purpose it is stored. If the data is incorrect, you have a right to rectification (Art. 16 GDPR), and under the conditions of Art. 17 GDPR you may demand that we delete the data.</p>
<h4>Right to restriction of processing</h4>
<p>In certain situations, according to Art. 18 GDPR, you may demand that we restrict the processing of your data. The data may then - apart from storage - only be processed as follows:</p>
<ul>
 <li>with your consent</li>
 <li>for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims</li>
 <li>to protect the rights of another natural or legal person</li>
 <li>for reasons of important public interest of the European Union or a Member State.</li>
</ul>
<p>The right to restrict processing exists in the following situations:</p>
<ul>
 <li>You have disputed the accuracy of your personal data stored by us and we need time to verify this. The right exists for the duration of the review.</li>
 <li>The processing of your personal data is unlawful or was unlawful in the past. The right exists alternatively to the deletion of the data.</li>
 <li>We no longer need your personal data, but you need it to exercise, defend or assert legal claims. The right exists alternatively to the deletion of the data.</li>
 <li>You have filed an objection pursuant to Art. 21 (1) GDPR and now your interests and our interests must be weighed against each other. The right exists as long as the result of the balancing of interests has not yet been determined.</li>
</ul>
<div>
 <h2>Hosting and Content Delivery Networks (CDN)</h2>
</div>
<div>
 <h3>External hosting</h3>
 <p>Our website is hosted on a server of the following Internet service provider (hoster):</p>
 <div>
  <p>IONOS SE<br />Elgendorfer Str. 57<br />56410 Montabaur, Germany</p>
 </div>
 <h4>Has a data processing agreement been concluded with the hoster or are standard contractual clauses (SCC) in place?</h4>
 <p>Yes</p>
 <h4>How do we process your data?</h4>
 <p>The hoster stores all the data from our website. This includes all personal data that is collected automatically or through entering. This can be in particular: Your IP address, pages accessed, names, contact details and requests, as well as meta and communication data. When processing data, our hoster adheres to our instructions and always processes the data only insofar as this is necessary to fulfill the service obligation to us.</p>
 <h4>On what legal basis do we process your data?</h4>
 <p>Since we address potential customers via our website and maintain contacts with existing customers, the data processing by our hoster serves to initiate and fulfill contracts and is therefore based on Art. 6 (1) lit. b) GDPR. In addition, it is our legitimate interest as a company to provide a professional Internet offering that meets the necessary requirements for security, speed and efficiency. In this respect, we also process your data on the legal basis of Art. 6 (1) lit. f) GDPR.</p>
</div>
<h2>Data collection on this website</h2>
<div>
 <h2>Use of cookies</h2>
 <p>Our website places cookies on your device. These are small text files that are used for various purposes. Some cookies are technically necessary for the website to function at all (necessary cookies). Others are needed to perform certain actions or functions on the site (functional cookies). For example, without cookies it would not be possible to take advantage of a shopping cart in an online store. Still other cookies are used to analyze user behavior or to optimize advertising measures. If we use third-party services on our website, for example to process payment transactions, these companies may also leave cookies on your device when you access the website (so-called third-party cookies).</p>
 <h4>How do we process your data?</h4>
 <p>Session cookies are only stored on your device for the duration of a session. As soon as you close the browser, they therefore disappear by themselves. Permanent cookies, on the other hand, remain on your device unless you delete them yourself. This can, for example, lead to your user behavior being permanently analyzed. You can use the settings in your browser to influence how it handles cookies:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Do you want to be informed when cookies are set?</li>
  <li>Do you want to exclude cookies in general or for certain cases?</li>
  <li>Do you want cookies to be deleted automatically when you close the browser?</li>
 </ul>
 <p>If you disable or do not allow cookies, the functionality of the website may be limited.</p>
 <p>If we use cookies from other companies or for analysis purposes, we will inform you about this as part of this privacy policy. We also request your consent in this regard when you access our website.</p>
 <h4>On what legal basis do we process your data?</h4>
 <p>We have a legitimate interest in ensuring that our online offers can be used by visitors without technical problems and that all desired functions are available to them. The storage of necessary and functional cookies on your device therefore takes place on the legal basis of Art. 6 (1) lit. f) GDPR. We use all other cookies on the legal basis of Art. 6 (1) lit. a) GDPR, provided you give us your consent. You can revoke this at any time with effect for the future. If you have consented to the placement of necessary and functional cookies when requesting consent, these cookies will also be stored exclusively on the basis of your consent.</p>
</div>
<div>
 <h3>Cookie consent with Legal Cockpit</h3>
 <h4>What is the Legal Cockpit cookie tool?</h4>
 <p>Consent management platform (CMP) for obtaining and processing GDPR-compliant consent.</p>
 <h4>Who processes your data?</h4>
 <p>Legalcore AG, Reinhardtstr. 7, 10117 Berlin, Germany</p>
 <h4>Has a data processing agreement been concluded with Legal Cockpit?</h4>
 <p>Yes</p>
 <h4>Where can you find more information about data protection at Legal Cockpit?</h4>
 <p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://cockpit.legal/datenschutz/">https://cockpit.legal/datenschutz/</a></p>
 <h4>How do we process your data?</h4>
 <p>We use Legal Cockpit's consent management platform to obtain your consent to store cookies on your device in a data protection compliant manner. When you visit our website and close the Legal Cockpit cookie window requesting consent, the following data is transmitted to the company:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>your IP address</li>
  <li>information about your browser</li>
  <li>information about your terminal device</li>
  <li>the time of your visit to the website</li>
 </ul>
 <p>In addition, the Legal Cockpit stores a cookie in your browser in order to be able to assign the consent given or its revocation to your browser. All collected data is stored until the cookies are no longer needed, you delete the Legal Cockpit cookie or request us to delete the data. This does not apply only if we are required by law to retain the data.</p>
 <h4>On what legal basis do we process your data?</h4>
 <p>We are legally obliged to obtain the consent of our website visitors for the use of certain cookies. In order to fulfill this obligation, we use Legal Cockpit. The legal basis for data processing is therefore Art. 6 (1) lit. c) GDPR.</p>
</div>
<h2>Server log files</h2>
<p>Server log files log all requests and accesses to our website and record error messages. They also include personal data, in particular your IP address. However, this is anonymized by the provider after a short time, so that we cannot assign the data to your person. The data is automatically transmitted to our provider by your browser.</p>
<h4>How do we process your data?</h4>
<p>Our provider stores the server log files in order to be able to track the activities on our website and to locate errors. The files contain the following data:</p>
<ul>
 <li>browser type and version</li>
 <li>operating system used</li>
 <li>referrer URL</li>
 <li>host name of the accessing computer</li>
 <li>Time of the server request</li>
 <li>IP address (anonymized if necessary)</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not combine this data with other data but use it only for statistical analysis and to improve our website.</p>
<h4>On what legal basis do we process your data?</h4>
<p>We have a legitimate interest in ensuring that our website runs without errors. It is also our legitimate interest to obtain an anonymized overview of the accesses to our website. Therefore, the data processing is lawful according to Art. 6 (1) lit. f) GDPR.</p>
<div>
 <h2>Inquiry by e-mail, telephone or fax</h2>
 <p>You can send us a message by e-mail or fax or call us.</p>
 <h4>How do we process your data?</h4>
 <p>We store your message as well as your self-made contact details or the transmitted telephone number in order to be able to process your inquiry including follow-up questions. We do not pass on the data to other persons without your consent.</p>
 <h4>How long do we store your data?</h4>
 <p>We delete your data as soon as one of the following occurs:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Your inquiry has been conclusively processed.</li>
  <li>You request us to delete the data.</li>
  <li>You revoke your consent to the storage.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>This does not apply only if we are required by law to retain the data.</p>
 <h4>On what legal basis do we process your data?</h4>
 <p>If your request is related to our contractual relationship or serves the implementation of pre-contractual measures, we process your data on the legal basis of Art. 6 (1) lit. b) GDPR. In all other cases, it is our legitimate interest to effectively process requests directed to us. The legal basis for data processing is therefore Art. 6 (1) lit. f) GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of your data, Art. 6 (1) lit. a) GDPR is the legal basis. In this case, you can revoke your consent at any time with effect for the future.</p>
</div>
<div>
 <h2>Registration function</h2>
 <p>In order to use certain functions or offers on our website, you must register. This requires you to provide your e-mail address and possibly other personal data.</p>
 <h4>How do we process your data?</h4>
 <p>We store the data you provide during registration and use it to provide you with the function or offer for which you have registered. If there are any changes in relation to the offer or function, we will use your e-mail address to inform you about them. In addition, we use your e-mail address to make you further contract offers, if necessary.</p>
 <h4>How long do we store your data?</h4>
 <p>We delete your data as soon as one of the following occurs:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>The purpose of the data processing has ceased to apply.</li>
  <li>You request us to delete the data.</li>
  <li>You revoke your consent to the storage.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>The only time this does not apply is when we are legally obligated to retain the data.</p>
 <h4>On what legal basis do we process your data?</h4>
 <p>We store and use your data to fulfill the user relationship established during registration and, if necessary, to initiate further contracts. The legal basis is therefore Art. 6 (1) lit. b) GDPR.</p>
</div>

<div>
 <h3>YouTube (with extended data protection)</h3>
 <h4>What is YouTube?</h4>
 <p>Video plattform</p>
 <h4>Who processes your data?</h4>
 <p>Google Ireland Ltd, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland</p>
 <h4>Where can you find more information about data protection at YouTube?</h4>
 <p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/intl/ALL_de/howyoutubeworks/our-commitments/protecting-user-data/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIztKuysSW-gIVjgwGAB0euwPlEAAYASAAEgLBXfD_BwE">https://www.youtube.com/intl/ALL_de/howyoutubeworks/our-commitments/protecting-user-data/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIztKuysSW-gIVjgwGAB0euwPlEAAYASAAEgLBXfD_BwE</a></p>
 <h4>How do we process your data?</h4>
 <p>You can watch YouTube videos on our website. In doing so, Google, as the provider of YouTube, collects and stores certain information about you. However, since we use YouTube in extended data protection mode, this only happens when you start a video. Specifically, the following happens in this case:</p>
 <ol>
  <li>Google's servers are told which of our pages were visited from your device. If you are logged into your YouTube account while surfing, Google can assign your surfing behavior directly to your personal profile. If you do not want this, you must log out of your YouTube account before you continue surfing the Internet.</li>
  <li>Google receives information about visitors to our website via cookies, device fingerprinting or similar recognition technologies. On this basis, the company then compiles video statistics, makes its application more attractive to users and prevents fraud attempts.</li>
  <li>If necessary, your data may also be processed beyond this. However, details are beyond our knowledge. Also, we can not influence the processing.</li>
 </ol>
 <p>Even if you do not start a YouTube video on our website, Google establishes a connection to its DoubleClick network and possibly also to other partners. The extended data protection mode therefore does not mean that Google does not process any data from you at all when you visit our website.</p>
 <h4>On what legal basis do we process your data?</h4>
 <p>By integrating YouTube videos, we want to make our website and our services and offers more appealing. This is our legitimate interest as a company and therefore lawful according to Art. 6 (1) lit. f) GDPR.</p>
 <p>If you have consented to data processing, we process your data exclusively on the basis of Art. 6 (1) lit. a) GDPR. You may revoke your consent at any time. From the time of revocation, we may no longer process your data.</p>
</div>
<div>
 <h3>Google Fonts (local hosting)</h3>
 <p>We use fonts from the US company Google on our website. We have installed the fonts locally, so there is no connection to Google's servers when you visit our website.</p>
 <p>For more information about Google Fonts, please visit <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq">https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq</a> and read Google's privacy policy: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=de">https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=de</a>.</p>
</div>
<div>
 <h3>Font Awesome (local hosting)</h3>
 <p>We use icons from the Font Awesome icon library on our website. The library is provided by Fonticons Inc. We have installed the icons locally, so there is no connection to the company's servers when you visit our website.</p>
 <p>For more information about Font Awesome, please visit <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://fontawesome.com/">https://fontawesome.com/</a> and specifically see their privacy policy there: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://fontawesome.com/privacy">https://fontawesome.com/privacy</a>.</p>

 <h3>jQuery</h3>
 <h4>What is jQuery?</h4>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Service that provides access to a JavaScript library for use on this website</p>
 <h4>Who processes your data?</h4>
 <p style="text-align: justify">The OpenJS Foundation, 548 Market St, PMB 57274, San Francisco, California, USA</p>
 <h4>Where can you find more information about data protection at jQuery?</h4>
 <p style="text-align: justify"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://openjsf.org/privacy">https://openjsf.org/privacy</a></p>
 <h4>On what basis do we transfer your data to the USA?</h4>
 <p style="text-align: justify">jQuery adheres to the standard contractual clauses of the European Commission (see <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://openjsf.org/privacy">https://openjsf.org/privacy</a>)</p>
 <h4>How do we process your data?</h4>
 <p style="text-align: justify">We use the services of jQuery on our website. jQuery is a JavaScript library. It simplifies Javascript programming by providing an easy-to-use interface for many common tasks. With jQuery, users can make their websites faster and more interactive. When you visit our website, a direct connection is established between your browser and the jQuery servers. This is how jQuery learns that our website was accessed via your IP address.</p>
 <h4>On what legal basis do we process your data?</h4>
 <p style="text-align: justify">jQuery's fonts ensure a consistent typeface on our websites. As a company, we have a legitimate interest in this. The data processing is therefore lawful according to Art. 6 (1) lit. f) GDPR.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">If you have consented to the data processing, we process your data exclusively on the basis of Art. 6 (1) lit. a) GDPR. You may revoke your consent at any time. From the time of revocation, we may no longer process your data.</p>
</div>
<div>
 <h3>Spotify</h3>
 <h4>What is Spotify?</h4>
 <p>Audio streaming service</p>
 <h4>Who processes your data?</h4>
 <p>Spotify AB, Regeringsgatan 19, 111 53 Stockholm, Sweden.</p>
 <h4>Where can you find more information about data protection at Spotify?</h4>
 <p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.spotify.com/de/legal/privacy-policy/">https://www.spotify.com/de/legal/privacy-policy/</a></p>
 <h4>How do we process your data?</h4>
 <p>We use Spotify plugins on our website. You can recognize them by the green logo. When you visit our website, your browser establishes a direct connection to the Spotify server. Spotify thus learns that a device with your IP address has visited our website. If you are logged into your Spotify account when you click the Spotify button on our website, Spotify can assign the visit to our website to your personal profile. If you do not want this, you must log out of your Spotify account before you continue surfing the Internet.</p>
 <p>Spotify also uses cookies from Google Analytics, a tool for collecting and analyzing user behavior on the Internet from the US company Google LLC. You must therefore assume that your data will be passed on to Google. We have no influence on this.</p>
 <h4>On what legal basis do we process your data?</h4>
 <p>By integrating Spotify plugins, we would like to make our website an acoustic experience for visitors as well. This is our legitimate interest as a company and therefore lawful according to Art. 6 (1) lit. f) GDPR.</p>
 <p>If you have consented to data processing, we process your data exclusively on the basis of Art. 6 (1) lit. a) GDPR. You may revoke your consent at any time. From the time of revocation, we may no longer process your data.</p>
</div>
<div>
 <h2>eCommerce and payment providers</h2>
</div>
<div>
 <h3>Customer and contract data</h3>
 <h4>How do we process your data?</h4>
 <p>When we conclude a contract with you, we require certain personal data from you. We collect, process and use this data only insofar as it is necessary to establish our legal relationship, to shape its content or to change it. If you can only use our services via our website or if the services are billed via the website, we also collect usage data insofar as this is necessary to enable you to use our offer or to bill the service used.</p>
 <h4>How long do we store your data?</h4>
 <p>We store your data until our legal relationship ends, unless we are required by law to keep the data longer.</p>
 <h4>On what legal basis do we process your data?</h4>
 <p>We store your data in order to fulfill the contract with you or to carry out pre-contractual measures. The basis of the data processing is therefore Art. 6 (1) lit. b) GDPR.</p>
</div>
<div>
 <h3>Data transfer when using services and digital content.</h3>
 <h4>How do we process your data?</h4>
 <p>For the processing of the payment, we transmit your data to a payment service or the credit institution commissioned with the payment processing. We only pass on data that is absolutely necessary for the payment process. If we want to pass on data beyond this, we will obtain your consent.</p>
 <h4>On what legal basis do we process your data?</h4>
 <p>We pass on your data in order to fulfill the contract we have concluded with you. The basis of the data processing is therefore Art. 6 (1) lit. b) GDPR.
